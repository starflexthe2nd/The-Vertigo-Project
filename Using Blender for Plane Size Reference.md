While the Blender measurement gives great ability to measure planes, the Blender measurements may be a few mm off IRL


It depends on the developer, for example the IRL 182RG is scaled by .915 )91.5%) based on Carenados models.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR BLENDER MEASUREMENTS:

The "Easy method" would be to search up how to paint liveries, that will give you an updated example on how to import models into blender via MSFS.



Hopwever,
I will write up a basic instructional sheet on how to-do this however this could easily become out of date fast.

In order to import a plane model into blender, you must use the msfs2blend plugin:
https://github.com/bestdani/msfs2blend

Use the github instructions if you are unable to figure out how to install the plugin, once installed and enabled in blender:

- Go to File > Import > MSFS GLTF
- Find your MSFS Directory and go to the "Offiical" Folder.
- Find the Plane you are wanting to measure
- Go into the "Model" folder
- Click on the lowest LOD cockpit model for the specific plane you want (Works for default or modded planes.)

Once imported use Blender's measuring tools in order to measure your specific area.
