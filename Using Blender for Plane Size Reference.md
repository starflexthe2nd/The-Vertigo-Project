While the Blender measurement gives great ability to measure planes, the Blender measurements may be a few mm off IRL


It depends on the developer, for example the IRL 182RG is scaled by .915 )91.5%) based on Carenados models.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR BLENDER MEASUREMENTS:

The "Easy method" would be to search up how to paint liveries, that will give you an updated example on how to import models into blender via MSFS.



Hopwever,
I will write up a basic instructional sheet on how to-do this however this could easily become out of date fast.

In order to import a plane model into blender, you must use the msfs2blend plugin:
https://github.com/bestdani/msfs2blend

Use the github instructions if you are unable to figure out how to install the plugin, once installed and enabled in blender:

- Go to File > Import > MSFS GLTF
- Find your MSFS Directory and go to the "Offiical" Folder or "Community" Folder depending on the type of plane you want to edit, custom - community, default - official.
- Find the Plane folder you are wanting to measure
- Once you are in the directory of the plane, go to SimObjects, then Airplanes then the name of the plane, if ther'e smultiple choose the panel varient you want to make
- Go into the "Model" folder
- Click on the lowest LOD cockpit model for the specific plane you want (Works for default or modded planes.) -- the lower the higher quality, the higher the lower quality.

Once imported use Blender, delete sections of the plane that might be covering what you want to make, these may be
texturing effects like ambient occlusion or various other things developers use to make effects in the game however they are not useful to us.
measuring tools in order to measure your specific area.

NOTICE: This is not a way to pirate game assets, these models are practically unusable once exported again as the geometries are heavily morphed, this is using the default illustrated way to make a livery in the game with blender, please respect developers and please do not share content to others like this, remember you are still under the
license agrement set out by the developers of the aircraft you are creating, and sharing the files of the aircrafts is still pirating and illegal.
