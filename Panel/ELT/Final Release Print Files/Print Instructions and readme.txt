Print instructions:

Ideally you should use a glass plate or a smooth plate for the visible parts for the best view (Mainly just the front plate) 

Please view the image in the print release files folder for the print directions.
If asked whether to join multiple bodies in slicer choose YES, else make sure that the two parts in the switch are still in place if you move them around.

SUPPORTS ARE NEEDED FOR:

- Front plate
- Switch

Use any other slicer settings you want.
