# The-Vertigo-Project
The Veritgo project is a home cockpit project based around the Vertigo in MSFS

The Vertigo is a plane built by GotFriends in Microsoft Flight Simualtor which is meant to mimick the plane "turbulence" which is a modified lancair legacy.
More information found here:
https://www.got-friends.com/products/vertigo

Now while the Vertigo is the plane I will be building this around, the actual plane is a JMB VL-3 panel as MSFS does not include a lancair legacy external model and the closest thing Got Friends have found to work with is the JMB VL-3, so although it's the "Vertigo project" this should mostly work for a Vl-3 cockpit panel also.

The main panel will be the panel which includes:
2 G3X
GTN 750

I will try to be as in-depth as possible, and try to provide a realistic end experiance if anyone wants to use any of the designs avaliable it will be as close to realistic size as I can get.

This is a continual WIP and will be in work for the next couple of months upto 8 or so months (from 1/05/24) after then the project will either no longer be supported or will be left idle or at a far slower pace.
Indepth tutorials will be made to assemble certian parts of the simulator home cockpit however documentation takes a lot of skill, knowledge, and time to write, therefore updates may be added without documentation
to begin with and will be added later.


Potential future features:

- FFB center stick
- Mechanical Trim stick
- Working G3X and GTN 750 designs open sourced.

More will be added as the future goes on.
